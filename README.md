In this project i have made a model which can predict the death cause due to heart failure.It helps drs to diagonise the patients.
In the first model i have considered all variables and done the predictions.On my predictions when i created confusion matrix it given me 79% accuracy.The next time i only considered significant variables and devleoped the model.When i did the preedictions on sign variables model it given me 80% accuray.
